## Homework tasks:

- [x] eBay header link test cases:
      use variable to keep one method/step for all
      keep meaningful naming convention for your steps

- [ ] (extra) Main content links with flyout menus
      keep meaningful naming convention for your steps

## Results

The laziest way of navigating through the menu was implemented.

#### **There are two questions:**

1. Is this way of testing allowed in real practice?
2. How can I use the "browser" pointer in my class? For example, pass this pointer to the "Links" class. If I use class inheritance, how can I do it correctly?

_Unfortunately the additional task has not been realized yet, as I was working on the weekend and didn't have enough time._
