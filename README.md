Hello!
I would like to get your opinion on my format for submitting homework via GitHub.
I think it's a more convenient way to keep track of changes and progress.

## :white_check_mark: What has been done

#### The required environment is installed and configured

Thanks for the heads up on the python 3.9.x version. I was curious and compared these versions and found a huge difference. Moreover, I was surprised that some of the usual tricks don't work now or don't work properly.

I think it will be convenient to sort the work by one or several lessons. The folder tree for a lesson looks as below. Let me know if something is wrong, please.

There are additional libraries in the requirenments.txt file. This is because I used my own Python virtual environment template to work with the Web. If required, I can remove unnecessary ones or create an environment from an empty Python template.

```python

behave==1.2.6
certifi==2023.11.17
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
exceptiongroup==1.2.0
